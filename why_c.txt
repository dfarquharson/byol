Argument from Freedom:
    - 'direct' access to the machine and 'straightforward' mapping to assembly.
    - lack of garbage collection means total control over memory mapping (blessing and curse)

Argument from Transparency:
    - no 'runtime' to hide behind.
    - disassembly easy to access and 'straightforward' to map between C source and generated assembly.

Argument from Lack of Bullshit:
	- no bullshit.
	- simple types.
		(weak typing a plus? doesn't hide reality? or is it just a leaky abstraction?)
	- basic abstraction of 'lots of memory addresses'
		(for the record, this is still an abstraction. This is not raw,
		 arch-specific assembly. However, this is a light-weight abstraction)
