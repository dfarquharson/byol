Argument from Freedom:
    - 'direct' access to the machine and 'straightforward' mapping to assembly.
    - lack of garbage collection means total control over memory mapping (blessing and curse)

Argument from Transparency:
    - no 'runtime' to hide behind.
    - disassembly easy to access and 'straightforward' to map between C source and generated assembly.
